  "summary": "This video provides a detailed overview of the application's navigation system. It explains the two primary navigation areas: the top right corner for switching between multiple databases or sub-accounts, and the left-side black vertical bar for accessing various features such as Home, Create, Reports, Subscribers, and Admin. Each main navigation option contains sub-menus for more specific functions. Additionally, the video covers the Chooser feature for storing files and the process for logging out or switching between sub-accounts.",
  "transcript": "The main navigation for the application runs along the left side of the page. In this black bar. There's different options depending on what you need to perform and each of them has its own menu of further options, so starting at the top the home button will bring you back to this dashboard page. The create menu, anything that has to do with creating content will live here. So that's project view where you build and send emails, sms, microsites, video and dynamic tags contains tools like video, countdown clocks or image carousels. Next is templates where you build your email templates, next is calendar invites, then forms, then surveys, then polls then quizzes. All of that will live inside the create menu. Next button down is reports where there are multiple different types of reports for you to use. The next option down is Subs, so that's our subscribers. Anything that we need to do to manage our audience would be in this menu and then admin is the last main option here and this is just settings. In the bottom left we see the chooser and the chooser is where you can store all of the files that you might need to use in your emails. So that's your images and word documents and PDFs and other files like that. Further down is a button to access to help resources. And then a log out option. If you happen to be in an account that has multiple sub accounts. You can toggle between those sub accounts in the very top right of the app, so here you'll find your company name and then your sub accounts if you. Click. On the one that you see visible, this is the one I'm currently inside of. I can click that and see the list of other sub accounts that I can switch into it.",
