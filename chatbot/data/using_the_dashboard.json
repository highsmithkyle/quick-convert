  "summary": "This video provides an in-depth look at the Dashboard, the first page you see upon logging into the application. It highlights key components such as the broadcast calendar, broadcast results, projects and latest editions, announcements, support contact information, a floating chat icon, broadcast performance charts, and active subscriber statistics. These elements offer valuable insights and quick access to various features within the application.",
  "transcript": "Your dashboard can give you lots of helpful data points about how things are going in your account. In the top left is the broadcast calendar, which gives you a visual representation of the current month and how many broadcasts are scheduled to be sent or have been sent in the past you can see. On May the 15th, there is a blue number which shows the number of broadcasts on that day. Under that are the broadcast results, which displays the five most recently sent mails broadcasted emails and they will be listed out here in reverse chronological order and you can quickly see the name, the date, how many mails were sent, and then click the little graph icon to quickly get to the broadcast summary report for that broadcast. The next block down in the bottom left are projects and latest editions, so these are the most recently created emails in your account, so this is what you are most recently working on so you can quickly send yourself a test or get to those emails you're working on. Up in the top right, you'll see any sort of announcements that we feel you need to know about. They'll be shown in this box and you can click this to get more information. There's also support contact information if you need to get a hold of someone for help. There's also e-mail and then phone call. In the bottom left corner of the screen is the floating chat icon. Under the contact information is a broadcast chart of the last 10 broadcasts and the open and click rate for each of those, so you can see you'll have a line graph, and then finally below in the bottom right is the active subscribers is similarly a line graph, but it shows you month over month. What percentage of all of your subscribers are active in any given month.",
